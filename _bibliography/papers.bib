  abstract = {Iceberg melting is a critical factor for climate change. However, the shape of an iceberg is an often neglected aspect of its melting process. Our study investigates the influence of different ice shapes and ambient flow velocities on melt rates by conducting direct numerical simulations of a simplified system of bluff body flow. Our study focuses on the ellipsoidal shape, with the aspect ratio as the control parameter. We found the shape plays a crucial role in the melting process, resulting in significant variations in the melt rate between different shapes. Without flow, the optimal shape for a minimal melt rate is the disk (two-dimensional) or sphere (three-dimensional), due to the minimal surface area. However, as the ambient flow velocity increases, the optimal shape changes with the aspect ratio. We find that ice with an elliptical shape (when the long axis is aligned with the flow direction) can melt up to 10% slower than a circular shape when exposed to flowing water. Following the approach considered by Huang et al. (<i>J. Fluid Mech.</i>, vol. 765, 2015, R3) for dissolving bodies, we provide a quantitative theoretical explanation for this optimal shape, based on the combined contributions from both surface-area effects and convective-heat-transfer effects. Our findings provide insight into the interplay between phase transitions and ambient flows, contributing to our understanding of the iceberg melting process and highlighting the need to consider the aspect-ratio effect in estimates of iceberg melt rates.},

  abstract = {Melting and solidification processes, intertwined with convective flows, play a fundamental role in geophysical contexts. One of these processes is the formation of melt ponds on glaciers, ice shelves, and sea ice. It is driven by solar radiation and is of great significance for Earth's heat balance, as it significantly lowers the albedo. Through direct numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we unveil a bistability phenomenon in the melt pond dynamics. As solar radiation intensity and the melt pond's initial depth vary, an abrupt transition occurs: this tipping point transforms the system from a stable fully frozen state to another stable equilibrium state, characterized by a distinct melt pond depth. The physics of this transition can be understood within a heat flux balance model, which exhibits excellent agreement with our numerical results. Together with the Grossmann-Lohse theory for internally heated convection, the model correctly predicts the bulk temperature and the flow strength within the melt ponds, offering insight into the coupling of phase transitions with adjacent turbulent flows and the interplay between convective melting and radiation-driven processes.},

To get a better quantitative understanding of the physical mechanics at play in ice melting in salty water, we numerically investigate the lateral melting of an ice block in stably stratified saline water. The developing ice shape from our numerical results shows good agreement with the experiments and theory from Huppert & Turner (<i>J. Fluid Mech.</i>, vol. 100, 1980, pp. 367--384). Furthermore, we find that the melt rate of ice depends non-monotonically on the mean ambient salinity: it first decreases for increasing salt concentration until a local minimum is attained, and then increases again. This non-monotonic behaviour of the ice melt rate is due to the competition among salinity-driven buoyancy, temperature-driven buoyancy and salinity-induced stratification. We develop a theoretical model based on the force balance which gives a prediction of the salt concentration for which the melt rate is minimal, and is consistent with our data. Our findings give insight into the interplay between phase transitions and double-diffusive convective flows.},

  abstract = {We numerically study the melting process of a solid layer heated from below such that a liquid melt layer develops underneath. The objective is to quantitatively describe and understand the emerging topography of the structures (characterized by the amplitude and wavelength), which evolve out of an initially smooth surface. By performing both two-dimensional (achieving Rayleigh number up to \(Ra=10^\{11\}\)\ and three-dimensional (achieving Rayleigh number up to \(Ra=10^9\)) direct numerical simulations with an advanced finite difference solver coupled to the phase-field method, we show how the interface roughness is spontaneously generated by thermal convection. With increasing height of the melt the convective flow intensifies and eventually even becomes turbulent. As a consequence, the interface becomes rougher but is still coupled to the flow topology. The emerging structure of the interface coincides with the regions of rising hot plumes and descending cold plumes. We find that the roughness amplitude scales with the mean height of the liquid layer. We derive this scaling relation from the Stefan boundary condition and relate it to the non-uniform distribution of heat flux at the interface. For two-dimensional cases, we further quantify the horizontal length scale of the morphology, based on the theoretical upper and lower bounds given for the size of convective cells known from Wang et al. (<i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i>, vol. 125, 2020, 074501). These bounds agree with our simulation results. Our findings highlight the key connection between the morphology of the melting solid and the convective flow structures in the melt beneath.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the ablation of vertical ice faces in salt water, we use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations to investigate the heat and salt fluxes in two-scalar vertical convection. For parameters relevant to ice-ocean interfaces in the convection-dominated regime, we observe that the salinity field drives the convection and that heat is essentially transported as a passive scalar. By varying the diffusivity ratio of heat and salt (i.e., the Lewis number \(Le\)), we identify how the different molecular diffusivities affect the scalar fluxes through the system. Away from the walls, we find that the heat transport is determined by a turbulent Prandtl number of \(Pr_t \approx 1\)\ and that double-diffusive effects are practically negligible. However, the difference in molecular diffusivities plays an important role close to the boundaries. In the (unrealistic) case where salt diffused faster than heat, the ratio of salt-to-heat fluxes would scale as \(Le^\{1/3\}\), consistent with classical nested scalar boundary layers. However, in the realistic case of faster heat diffusion (relative to salt), we observe a transition towards a \(Le^\{1/2\}\)\ scaling of the ratio of the fluxes. This coincides with the thermal boundary layer width growing beyond the thickness of the viscous boundary layer. We find that this transition is not determined by a critical Lewis number, but rather by a critical Prandtl number \(Pr \approx 10\), slightly below that for cold seawater where \(Pr=14\). We compare our results to similar studies of sheared and double-diffusive flow under ice shelves, and discuss the implications for fluxes in large-scale ice-ocean models. By coupling our results to ice-ocean interface thermodynamics, we describe how the flux ratio impacts the interfacial salinity, and hence the strength of solutal convection and the ablation rate.},

We use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of a vertical channel with differentially heated walls to investigate such convective, turbulent boundary layers. Through the implementation of a multiple-resolution technique, we are able to perform simulations at a wide range of Prandtl numbers \(Pr\). This allows us to distinguish the parameter dependences of the horizontal heat flux and the boundary layer widths in terms of the Rayleigh number \(Ra\)\ and Prandtl number \(Pr\). For the considered parameter range \(1\leq Pr\leq 100\), \(10^6\leq Ra\leq 10^9\), we find the flow to be consistent with a 'buoyancy-controlled' regime where the heat flux is independent of the wall separation. For given \(Pr\), the heat flux is found to scale linearly with the friction velocity \(V\_\ast\). Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the parameterisation of heat and salt fluxes at vertical ice-ocean interfaces.},

  abstract = {The breaking of internal gravity waves in the abyssal ocean is thought to be responsible for much of the mixing necessary to close oceanic buoyancy budgets. The exact mechanism by which these waves break down into turbulence remains an active area of research and can have significant implications on the mixing efficiency. Recent evidence has suggested that both shear instabilities and convective instabilities play a significant role in the breaking of an internal gravity wave in a high Richardson number mean shear flow. We perform a systematic analysis of the stability of a configuration of an internal gravity wave superimposed on a background shear flow first considered by Howland et al. (<i>J. Fluid Mech.</i>, vol. 921, 2021, A24), using direct-adjoint looping to find the perturbation giving maximal energy growth on this evolving flow. We find that three-dimensional, convective mechanisms produce greater energy growth than their two-dimensional counterparts. In particular, we find close agreement with the direct numerical simulations of Howland et al. (<i>J. Fluid Mech.</i>, vol. 921, 2021, A24), which demonstrated a clear three-dimensional mechanism causing breakdown to turbulence. The results are shown to hold at realistic Prandtl numbers. At low mean Richardson numbers, two-dimensional, shear-driven mechanisms produce greater energy growth.},

  abstract = {Motivated by observations of turbulence in the strongly stratified ocean thermocline, we use direct numerical simulations to investigate the interaction of a sinusoidal shear flow and a large-amplitude internal gravity wave. Despite strong nonlinearities in the flow and a lack of scale separation, we find that linear ray-tracing theory is qualitatively useful in describing the early development of the flow as the wave is refracted by the shear. Consistent with the linear theory, the energy of the wave accumulates in regions of negative mean shear where we observe evidence of convective and shear instabilities. Streamwise-aligned convective rolls emerge the fastest, but their contribution to irreversible mixing is dwarfed by shear-driven billow structures that develop later. Although the wave strongly distorts the buoyancy field on which these billows develop, the mixing efficiency of the subsequent turbulence is similar to that arising from Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a stratified shear layer. We run simulations at Reynolds numbers \(Re\)\ of 5000 and 8000, and vary the initial amplitude of the internal gravity wave. For high values of initial wave amplitude, the results are qualitatively independent of \(Re\). Smaller initial wave amplitudes delay the onset of the instabilities, and allow for significant laminar diffusion of the internal wave, leading to reduced turbulent activity. We discuss the complex interaction between the mean flow, internal gravity wave and turbulence, and its implications for internal wave-driven mixing in the ocean.},

  abstract = {Turbulent mixing exerts a significant influence on many physical processes in the ocean. In a stably stratified Boussinesq fluid, this irreversible mixing describes the conversion of available potential energy (APE) to background potential energy (BPE). In some settings the APE framework is difficult to apply and approximate measures are used to estimate irreversible mixing. For example, numerical simulations of stratified turbulence often use triply periodic domains to increase computational efficiency. In this set-up, however, BPE is not uniquely defined and the method of Winters et al. (<i>J. Fluid Mech.</i>, vol. 289, 1995, pp. 115-128) cannot be directly applied to calculate the APE. We propose a new technique to calculate APE in periodic domains with a mean stratification. By defining a control volume bounded by surfaces of constant buoyancy, we can construct an appropriate background buoyancy profile \(b_\ast(z,t)\)\ and accurately quantify diapycnal mixing in such systems. This technique also permits the accurate calculation of a finite-amplitude local APE density in periodic domains. The evolution of APE is analysed in various turbulent stratified flow simulations. We show that the mean dissipation rate of buoyancy variance \(\chi\)\ provides a good approximation to the mean diapycnal mixing rate, even in flows with significant variations in local stratification. When quantifying measures of mixing efficiency in transient flows, we find significant variation depending on whether laminar diffusion of a mean flow is included in the kinetic energy dissipation rate. We discuss how best to interpret these results in the context of quantifying diapycnal diffusivity in real oceanographic flows.},

In each simulation the turbulence produced is spatially intermittent, with dissipation rates varying over orders of magnitude in the vertical. We focus analysis on the statistically quasi-steady states achieved by applying large-scale body forcing to the domain, and compare flows forced by internal gravity waves with those forced by vertically uniform vortical modes. By considering the turbulent energy budgets for each simulation, we find that the injection of potential energy from the wave forcing permits a reversal in the sign of the mean buoyancy flux. This change in the sign of the buoyancy flux is associated with large, convective density overturnings, which in turn lead to more efficient mixing in the wave-forced simulations. The inhomogeneous dissipation in each simulation allows us to investigate localised correlations between the kinetic and potential energy dissipation rates. These correlations lead us to the conclusion that an appropriate definition of an instantaneous mixing efficiency, \(\eta(t):=\chi/(\chi + \varepsilon)\) (where \(\varepsilon\)\ and \(\chi\)\ are the volume-averaged turbulent viscous dissipation rate and fluctuation density variance destruction rate respectively) in the wave-forced cases is independent of an appropriately defined local turbulent Froude number, consistent with scalings proposed for low Froude number stratified turbulence.},

Splashing is reduced or even eliminated: droplets on the softest substrates need over 70\% more kinetic energy to splash than they do on rigid substrates. We show that this is due to energy losses caused by deformations of soft substrates during the first few microseconds of impact. We find that solids with Young's moduli \( \lesssim 100 \, \textrm\{kPa\} \)\ reduce splashing, in agreement with simple scaling arguments. Thus, materials like soft gels and elastomers can be used as simple coatings for effective splash prevention.

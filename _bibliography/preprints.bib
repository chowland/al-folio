  abstract = {We consider the process of convective dissolution in a homogeneous and isotropic porous medium. The flow is unstable due to the presence of a solute that induces a density difference responsible for driving the flow. The mixing dynamics is thus driven by a Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the pore scale. We investigate the flow at the scale of the pores using experimental measurements, numerical simulations and physical models. Experiments and simulations have been specifically designed to mimic the same flow conditions, namely matching porosities, high Schmidt numbers, and linear dependency of fluid density with solute concentration. In addition, the solid obstacles of the medium are impermeable to fluid and solute. We characterise the evolution of the flow via the mixing length, which quantifies the extension of the mixing region and grows linearly in time. The flow structure, analysed via the centre-line mean wavelength, is observed to grow in agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we analyse the dissolution dynamics of the system, quantified through the mean scalar dissipation, and three mixing regimes are observed. Initially, the evolution is controlled by diffusion, which produces solute mixing across the initial horizontal interface. Then, when the interfacial diffusive layer is sufficiently thick, it becomes unstable, forming finger-like structures and driving the system into a convection-dominated phase. Finally, when the fingers have grown sufficiently to touch the horizontal boundaries of the domain, the mixing reduces dramatically due to the absence of fresh unmixed fluid. With the aid of simple physical models, we explain the physics of the results obtained numerically and experimentally.},

  abstract = {Iceberg melting is a critical factor for climate change, contributing to rising sea levels and climate change. However, the shape of an iceberg is an often neglected aspect of its melting process. Our study investigates the influence of different ice shapes and ambient flow velocities on melt rates by conducting direct numerical simulations. Our study focuses on the ellipsoidal shape, with the aspect ratio as the control parameter. It plays a crucial role in the melting process, resulting in significant variations in the melt rate between different shapes. Without flow, the optimal shape for a minimal melt rate is the disk (2D) or sphere (3D), due to the minimal surface area. However, as the ambient flow velocity increases, the optimal shape changes with the aspect ratio. We find that ice with an elliptical shape (when the long axis is aligned with the flow direction) can melt up to 10\textbackslash\% slower than a circular shape when exposed to flowing water. We provide a quantitative theoretical explanation for this optimal shape, based on the competition between surface area effects and convective heat transfer effects. Our findings provide insight into the interplay between phase transitions and ambient flows, contributing to our understanding of the iceberg melting process and highlighting the need to consider the aspect ratio effect in estimates of iceberg melt rates.},

I am a fluid dynamicist interested in the fundamental physics at the heart of various environmental and geophysical flows.
I use idealised numerical simulations to investigate the role of buoyancy and turbulence on processes in the natural environment.

High performance computing is a vital tool for my research, which also makes me interested in advanced numerical methods and how to deploy them at scale.
I have contributed to the development of a number of flow simulation software codes using both pseudospectral and finite difference methods, some of which you can find at the [repositories](/repositories) page.

I work as a postdoc in the Physics of Fluids group at the University of Twente, having previously studied for my PhD at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge.

In my spare time you can find me cooking, shaking cocktails, running around a tennis court, or playing cello in an orchestra.
More likely, you'll find me sat on the sofa enjoying some good TV drama.
